Initial release of the oss-prep skill — a 10-phase audit workflow for preparing private repositories for open-source release, with both interactive and fully autonomous modes plus real-time secret detection.

### Highlights

- **Interactive orchestrator** — 10-phase audit with state persistence, sub-agent dispatch, and progressive disclosure (Orchestrator)
- **Full-auto pipeline** — Autonomous mode with risk-aware archetype classification, 15 deterministic decision protocols, and scored readiness summary (Orchestrator)
- **oss-guard hook** — Real-time secret/PII detection for Claude Code Write/Edit operations (Guard)
