This is more maintainable than relying on prose paragraphs that describe the split — inline markers at each step heading make boundaries unambiguous.</ralph>\n\n<ralph>LEARN: When a phase file needs to duplicate content from another phase (like the PII allowlist in Phase 8's post-flatten verification), document WHY the duplication exists with an explicit header comment (e.g., \"duplicated from Phase 2 for sub-agent self-containment\"). This prevents future maintainers from removing the \"duplication\" as a cleanup, which would break the sub-agent's ability to run independently.</ralph>","stop_reason":null,"session_id":"6b107aa5-11c1-4c2e-8575-8032bf89ae72","total_cost_usd":1.4885635000000002,"usage":{"input_tokens":25,"cache_creation_input_tokens":52786,"cache_read_input_tokens":1301924,"output_tokens":19072,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":52786,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0},"inference_geo":"","iterations":[],"speed":"standard"},"modelUsage":{"claude-haiku-4-5-20251001":{"inputTokens":25984,"outputTokens":956,"cacheReadInputTokens":0,"cacheCreationInputTokens":0,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.030764,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":64000},"claude-opus-4-6":{"inputTokens":25,"outputTokens":19072,"cacheReadInputTokens":1301924,"cacheCreationInputTokens":52786,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":1.4577995000000001,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":32000}},"permission_denials":[],"uuid":"745eba75-c2ec-406d-aefb-bfeba08d0aec"}
