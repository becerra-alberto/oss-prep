The DD-4 constraint (sub-agents cannot interact with users) means any user-interactive steps must be documented as orchestrator-side work that passes results as inputs to the sub-agent. This pattern — orchestrator resolves interactive input, then passes it as a typed input to the sub-agent — will recur in any phase that needs user decisions before sub-agent execution.</ralph>","stop_reason":null,"session_id":"14b99a9b-aeac-48d1-b37d-cb10fc1013a7","total_cost_usd":1.1652714999999996,"usage":{"input_tokens":19,"cache_creation_input_tokens":40242,"cache_read_input_tokens":818765,"output_tokens":10615,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":40242,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0},"inference_geo":"","iterations":[],"speed":"standard"},"modelUsage":{"claude-haiku-4-5-20251001":{"inputTokens":5395,"outputTokens":222,"cacheReadInputTokens":0,"cacheCreationInputTokens":0,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.0065049999999999995,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":64000},"claude-opus-4-6":{"inputTokens":24,"outputTokens":14326,"cacheReadInputTokens":886593,"cacheCreationInputTokens":57152,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":1.1587664999999998,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":32000}},"permission_denials":[],"uuid":"fbeb73d6-3e2f-4644-8eb6-3acbc8d7c3e8"}
