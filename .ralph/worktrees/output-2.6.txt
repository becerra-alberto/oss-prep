The fallback must note which component (orchestrator vs sub-agent) handles the interaction, since sub-agents cannot interact with users directly. This pattern — primary/fallback with interaction-point documentation — makes the orchestrator's dispatch logic straightforward while keeping the phase file self-contained.</ralph>","stop_reason":null,"session_id":"2b40db92-ae4d-412b-ae9a-aaac59bbd202","total_cost_usd":1.70215575,"usage":{"input_tokens":21,"cache_creation_input_tokens":45937,"cache_read_input_tokens":931889,"output_tokens":10604,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":45937,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0},"inference_geo":"","iterations":[],"speed":"standard"},"modelUsage":{"claude-haiku-4-5-20251001":{"inputTokens":11302,"outputTokens":337,"cacheReadInputTokens":0,"cacheCreationInputTokens":0,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.012987,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":64000},"claude-opus-4-6":{"inputTokens":44,"outputTokens":15569,"cacheReadInputTokens":1576810,"cacheCreationInputTokens":81811,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":1.6891687499999997,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":32000}},"permission_denials":[],"uuid":"259c66d5-1a2d-4bd0-985a-7b84abbb1e21"}
