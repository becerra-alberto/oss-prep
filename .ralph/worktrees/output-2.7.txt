For phases that don't reference shared pattern libraries (secrets.md, pii.md), the self-containment test is simpler. The key structural elements to verify in every extracted phase file are: header block (phase number, name, inputs, outputs), all step numbers present, finding ID format with phase-specific prefix, user gate with all four options referencing the next phase, and state update documentation. For content-heavy phases with verbatim templates (YAML frontmatter, CI workflow variants, .gitignore tables), count the specific entries against the spec rather than relying on general pattern matching.</ralph>","stop_reason":null,"session_id":"1752ab54-b8d2-4e77-8dc2-0dbe3b415211","total_cost_usd":1.2172250000000002,"usage":{"input_tokens":24,"cache_creation_input_tokens":46188,"cache_read_input_tokens":1063398,"output_tokens":14955,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":46188,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0},"inference_geo":"","iterations":[],"speed":"standard"},"modelUsage":{"claude-haiku-4-5-20251001":{"inputTokens":20091,"outputTokens":553,"cacheReadInputTokens":0,"cacheCreationInputTokens":0,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.022855999999999998,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":64000},"claude-opus-4-6":{"inputTokens":24,"outputTokens":14955,"cacheReadInputTokens":1063398,"cacheCreationInputTokens":46188,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":1.1943690000000002,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":32000}},"permission_denials":[],"uuid":"54826de2-cd56-4d05-b629-da72d2150c8f"}
