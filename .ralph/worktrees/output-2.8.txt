When a phase is purely self-contained with inline patterns (identity leak regexes, SDK tables), the extraction is a straightforward copy-and-reformat with the header block/I/O/gate additions. The key structural difference from phases that reference shared patterns (like Phase 1 referencing patterns/secrets.md) is that self-contained phases are simpler to validate — just confirm all tables and regex patterns were preserved verbatim.</ralph>","stop_reason":null,"session_id":"9e928b3c-83b2-4ef6-935a-126e93034b31","total_cost_usd":1.48445125,"usage":{"input_tokens":18,"cache_creation_input_tokens":50471,"cache_read_input_tokens":823170,"output_tokens":10308,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":50471,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0},"inference_geo":"","iterations":[],"speed":"standard"},"modelUsage":{"claude-haiku-4-5-20251001":{"inputTokens":5028,"outputTokens":192,"cacheReadInputTokens":0,"cacheCreationInputTokens":0,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.005988,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":64000},"claude-opus-4-6":{"inputTokens":26,"outputTokens":16926,"cacheReadInputTokens":988729,"cacheCreationInputTokens":89731,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":1.4784632500000001,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":32000}},"permission_denials":[],"uuid":"d12db0d1-21b9-4cb5-9ff6-16fce21aa3fc"}
